        <uL>
            <li>3 eggs, beaten</li>
            <li>1 cup white sugar</li>

            <li>½ teaspoon ground cloves</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
            <li>1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
            <li>1 (16 ounce) package confectioners' sugar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1 cup chopped pecans</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons confectioners' sugar for dusting, or as needed</li>
        </uL>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Butter a 12x17-inch jelly roll pan and line with parchment paper; butter the parchment paper. Generously dust a kitchen towel with confectioners' sugar.</li>
            <li>Beat eggs, white sugar, and pumpkin together in a bowl until creamy.</li>
            <li>Sift flour, baking soda, cinnamon, cloves, and nutmeg together in a separate bowl; gradually stir into egg mixture. Stir to combine. Spread batter evenly into the prepared pan.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven for exactly 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Immediately turn cake onto the prepared kitchen towel. Starting at a long end, roll up pumpkin cake and towel. Let rolled cake rest for 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Beat cream cheese, butter, 16-ounce package confectioners' sugar, and vanilla extract together in a bowl until smooth; fold in pecans.</li>
            <li>Unroll cake; spread with the filling. Roll up cake (without towel). Cut off any jagged ends. Cover and refrigerate until chilled. Cut cake in half if desired; sprinkle with confectioners' sugar before serving.</li>
